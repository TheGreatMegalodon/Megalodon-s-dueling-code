## Help
While runing the mod you can always type:
```js
help
```
to see all the commands you can use.

⚠️ small skills in modding are required to use thoses commands.

### How to kick a player:
To kick a player it is very easy. While your mod is running, you first need to write in the console:
```js
info
```
Once you've done that
you will see that the mod, is going to reply you with something like this:

While looking at it, you can see a few informations.
firstly, you can obviously see this:
```js
 | Total amount of aliens: 0
 | Total amount of asteroids: 0
 | Total amount of players: 2
```
This shows you the number of aliens in the game the number of asteroids in the game and the number of players in the game.
thoses can be useful when you like to make a mess in modding!
